<h2>Entry</h2>
<p>
The <strong>water</strong> will normally be turned <strong>off</strong>. The stopcock is under the manhole cover to the right of the front door as you face the house. Temporarily remove the insulation and turn the tap anti-clockwise to open it.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>electricity</strong> will usually be <strong>on</strong>. The meter is on the outside wall of the house, just round to the left as you face the front. Please make a note of the reading. The fuse box is in the left hand room downstairs (the 'salon') to the right of the window. Most appliances will have been disconnected.
</p>
<p>
If the sofas are covered with <strong>dust sheets</strong>, remove them and store under the stairs in the storage boxes.
</p>
<p>
Just behind the front door, connect the telephone/internet plug and the power cable.
</p>
<h2>Exit</h2>
<p>Reverse the instructions for entry!</p>

	</ul>
<h2>Kitchen</h2>
<p>
We leave the big <strong>fridge</strong> on low. The second fridge for drinks can be used as well, but needs to be defrosted and switched off before leaving; leave the door ajar. The electric cooker is basic but heats up quickly. Store cupboard has usual basics, tea, coffee, sugar, flour, tins, herbs and spices. To prevent mouse activity, try and keep food in cupboards or tins or jars with lids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Washing machine</strong>  The instruction manual is on top of machine, and detergent etc under sinks. It is a small model, so don't overload. It works well and quickly if you use a 30 deg wash. Pegs in laundry bowl. Washing line in garden. The water supply tap on the wall behind used to leak a bit; we think it's now fixed, but just keep an eye on it and mop up if need be.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dishwasher</strong> The instructions (in English) are on top.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>water</strong> is very hard here - lots of chalk and build up of lime scale. Water is fine to drink -the house is on mains water and drains. There is a water filter Britta if you like to use this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rubbish/waste disposal</strong>: Black bin liners are for general waste and the bin is under the sink. Recycling is in the bin to the right as you enter the kitchen using yellow bags. Rules about what can be recycled are on top of the washing machine - mainly cardboard and paper, some cans and plastic bottles (but not caps). Please check first. However, all bottles and glass have to be taken to the bottle bank - nearest one is in Toulonjac behind the primary school, or else in Villefranche.
</p>
<p>
Every Tuesday (early) a.m. is the day for the bin men - bins are to the left of the converted barn opposite the front door, and are used by all the neighbours too. Thursday is the day for taking away the recycling bins but not sure if weekly or fortnightly.
</p>
<h2>Bedrooms</h2>
<p>There are two rooms upstairs - mind your head on the beams if tall - with a double bed in each. There is also a comfortable sofa-bed in the salon. All sheets, towels and pillow cases etc are stored in the big chests, so help yourselves to whatever you need. Another duvet is stored in chest downstairs in the 'salon', under the window. Depending on the temperature, you can choose either a lightweight duvet, or just sheets and cotton blankets. Towels are in the chest in the main bedroom to the left of the chimney breast. Also some swimming towels. Other chests upstairs have spare duvets, cotton blankets, pillows etc. There is a mosquito net which we have never used. Old hairdryer available in chest of drawers. Help yourselves to hanging space in wardrobe downstairs or in the bedroom. There are 3 big sunhats (female) and 2 lots of crocs, and gumboots if weather is not hot and sunny.
</p>
<h2>Electric Plugs</h2>
<p>Many of the plugs are very difficult to use, they need a good wiggle and then a lot of force to get them in properly. The new ones in the kitchen are easy.
</p>
<h2>Room heating</h2>
<p>There is an instruction manual for the wood burning stove in the instruction folder - but it is easy to light. Firewood and dry sticks are outside under cover below the kitchen window. There should always be a layer of wood-ash inside the stove, about 1- 2 inches. Use paper and anything else like cardboard plus a firelighter to light it. Matches are on the mantelpiece. Have the damper lever on the chimney vertical and open the door slides so there is a good draught. It usually lights very easily so long as the wood is dry. Shut the doors and once it is going well, you can close one or 2 of the door slides and even push the lever over to face the wall a bit. Unless you want to keep the fire going overnight, probably best to keep some of the damper and door slides open.
If you are at a loose end, you might like to collect any twigs and wood that has fallen in the garden to keep up the supply of kindling!
</p>
<p>There are also a couple of electric radiant heaters behind one of the chests in the upstairs bedroom which can be moved around as necessary.
</p>
<h2>Water heater</h2>
<p>The water heater is in the bathroom behind the screen.
It is switched on at the electric meter downstairs in the salon front wall. 
Look for the CH(auffe) EAU label to the bottom right of the board and pull down the black switch to switch on. 
Either leave on all the time – it is very efficient and well insulated - but you can switch it on and off if you want. Do not fiddle with the controls on the actual water heater itself. 
</p>
<p>
If there is a red light showing on the heater, it means there is a fault and it needs to be switched off. Normally you can see a green and amber light showing. The manual is with all other docs – maybe switch off and then on again to see if red light goes off. 
</p>
<p>There is a towel heater for cold/wet weather and for drying clothes.
</p>
<p>
There is one hot water bottle.
</p>
<h2>Shutters</h2>
<p>These are easy to close each evening, and if very hot, leave closed during the day to keep the house cool. There are blinds in the main bedroom inside the Velux windows, and these need to be used during the day to keep the bedroom cool. There are two fans for hot weather.
</p>
<h2>Phone, Internet and Computer</h2>
<p>The telephone is on a small table behind the front door. The number is: <strong>05 65 45 19 11</strong> within France and 00 33 5 65 45 19 11 from outside. If phoning the UK from the house, dial 00 44 and omit the first 0 of the UK number.
</p>
<p>The internet and WiFi should also be live a few minutes after connection. The security code is:
<strong>A770 F783 F694 06EC A6C5 0CA4 A7</strong>
and is also found inside the Livebox manual.
</p>
<p>
There is a laptop computer in the salon - please feel free to use it. Once the power cable is plugged in, the computer can be started by opening the screen and pressing the power button to the top left of the keyboard. It runs Windows 8, so when the first screen comes up, click to show the logins and then click on <strong>Guest</strong> - there is no password for this user. Connection to the internet is by built-in WiFi.
</p>
<h2>Television</h2>
<p>There is no live television, but there is a DVD player connected to the TV so bring your own - unless you want to watch old series of our choice. 
</p>
<h2>Garden</h2>
<p>There is a table and set of six chairs in the shady garden, and a table and four chairs on the top terrace. Four loungers are available for use by the pool and are stored under the outside set of steps, along with lots of garden tools.
</p>
<p>
The lawn mower is stored in the garden under a stone area in the hedge. If the grass looks as if it could do with a cut, the mower is easy to start - just press the bulb on the LH side two or three times to prime the carburettor, grip the throttle lever with your left hand and pull the starter rope with your right. It should go after two or three pulls. It is a four-stroke engine so uses separate petrol (in the tank on top) and occasional oil (via the plug lower down).
</p>
<p>There are two rain water tanks, one by the compost heap and the other in the front outside the kitchen. Please use these for watering plants, rather than using the mains water.
</p>
<p>Gentle weeding and picking of fruit if in season is encouraged and welcomed. Compost is in the grassy area. Use the compost bucket in the kitchen for storing kitchen waste before taking it out to the compost heap.
<h2>Swimming pool</h2>
<p>
The pool cover complies with French safety regulations and is intended to prevent a child or anyone falling into the pool and drowning. The pool therefore must be covered when the house is empty and no-one is around.  When children are present, you must cover the pool at any time when an adult is not supervising. It is easy and quick to use, so please make sure the pool is covered up when you leave to go out shopping etc. Also please cover the pool at night – this keeps the heat in.
</p>
<p><strong>To uncover the pool</strong></p>
<p>Unclip the three straps at each end of the pool (press sides and button in middle simultaneously). When all six are free, turn the key on the right hand side of the roller clockwise; the cover will start to roll up by itself and will stop automatically. You do not need to hold the key once it has started.
When the cover is clear, gently slide the pool steps towards you (away from the pool), until the hinge pin has gone as far back as it can, then lower the steps into the pool.
</p>
<p>If any large objects are in the pool, fish them out. There is a filter at the far end of the pool, which you should check each day and remove leaves, dead flies etc caught in the filter.
</p>
<p>There are inflateable things in the sejour, lilos in bottom of the wardrobe plus the armchair.
</p>
<p>There is a outdoor tap and hot/cold shower for the pool, round the back of the house near the thermometer. Please don't use and soap or shampoo here.
</p>
<p><strong>To cover the pool</strong></p>
<p>Take the steps out of the pool by lifting them towards you and sliding the hinge pin towards the pool. Ensure no-one is in the pool or any other float, lilo etc.
Turn the key anti-clockwise and the cover will begin to unroll over the pool. You have to keep holding the key until the pool is completely covered – this is a safety mechanism to make sure you don’t cover the pool with someone/something still in it. It stops automatically. Leave the key in place on the roller and fasten the three clips at each end. (There is a spare key on the key ring which is hung behind the front door along with other spare keys.)
</p>
<p><strong>Daily cleaning</strong></p>
<p>Use the net to skim the surface and to remove large objects from the bottom. Our convention is that the red plastic tag should be outside the net when using it in the pool. Remove leaves, etc. from the skimmer basket - the cover is in the middle at the top end of the pool.
<p>
<p><strong>Weekly maintenance</strong></p>
<p>If you have agreed to do the weekly maintenance then look at the relevant instructions. Otherwise the pool guy - Chris Grundy - will come regularly to check the chemicals and vaccuum the pool.
</p>
<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>Park outside the house or, if you prefer, bring the car into the garden by the side gate. We normally leave the gate open while we are here, but please close it when you leave or if you are away for a few days. If parking against the wall opposite, please avoid parking over the small cover (to the centre right) which Dominique (the cow man) uses.
</p>
<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>There are no shops in Toulonjac, so your nearest supermarket is <strong>Leclerc</strong> (which is huge and sells almost everything), situated on the road from the bypass to Villefranche. There are two ways to get there:
<ul>
<li>Drive through Toulonjac as if going to Villefranche. Take first right at the first roundabout you come to, signed Cahors and Montaubon. Join the main road and at the first roundabout take a left turn signed to Villefranche. At the next roundabout, turn left and Leclerc is on your left. (Petrol pumps on right at the roundabout)
</li>
<li>Leave Lacaze by the road to the right as you look out of the front door (past the Timms), take a dog's leg over the main road to the road opposite. This goes left and then sharp right as it joins a road coming up from the village. Go past the football and tennis courts (bottle bank) and keep on until you reach a left turn (opposite the field with deer) signed La Mathebie. Keep going on this road (approx 1.5 km) which will eventually lead you under the bypass and to Leclerc on your right.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Other supermarkets also in Viilefranche are:
<ul>
<li><strong>HyperU</strong>: Take the road through Toulonjac and head into Villefranche. HyperU is signed to the left at the first set of traffic lights. The supermarket is on your left.
</li>
<li><strong>Intermarche</strong>: Get to Leclerc and then continue down the main road to the centre of Villefranche. Intermarche will be signposted on the right.
</ul>
</p>
<p>You can get into Villefranche by staying on the road from Toulonjac and going under the bridge. Best to park in the centre and walk into the old centre or down to the bridges.
</p>
<p>Almost all shops close on Sunday and small shops also close on Monday. Intermarche is open Sunday mornings.
</p>
<p>Market day in Villefranche is on a Thursday - in high season, best to get there not too late, by 10.30 if poss. Parking is difficult but head for the car park you first come to when driving in to Villefranche by the direct route. It is a wonderful market right in the centre of the town, under the medieval arcades and all surrounding streets too.
